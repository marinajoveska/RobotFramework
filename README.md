# RobotFramework
Robot Framework is a Python-based, extensible keyword-driven automation framework for acceptance testing, acceptance test driven development (ATDD), behavior driven development (BDD) and robotic process automation (RPA). It can be used in distributed, heterogeneous environments, where automation requires using different technologies and interfaces.
With the help of this tool, several test scenarios have been created, many test cases that automatically test certain functionality of demo sites for creating orders, testing functionalities of social networks, and other pages in general. Database testing scenarios have also been executed in HeidiSQL, along with many test cases and stored procedures that prove their quality and security.
